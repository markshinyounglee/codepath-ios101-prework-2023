## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My 5 Favorite Applications and Reasons:
- Instagram:
    * Creating stories directly off the bat by scribbling some texts
    * Swiping across different photos and short videos
    * All chat data being saved in the cloud to be accessible in any devices
- Google Maps:
    * Directing the shortest route in seconds
    * Having Different landscape modes (default, satellite, ...)
    * Updating routes quickly in case of road condition changes
- Google photos:
    * Creating custom albums to bring back old memories
    * Deleting backed up photos to save more space in mobiles
- DuoLingo:
    * Recording voice, typing texts, and listening to native speakers
    * Tracking the learning progress like a quest
    * Identifying struggled words and making people practice repeatedly
    
### App Idea:
I moved around quite a lot lately, and I think I will continue to do so as I intern in many different locations and live my life potentially as a digital nomad. As a Christian, I noticed that I cannot really find an app that shows the list of churches with an option to choose service times. I usually resort to Google to find churches near me, but I have to select the list of churches every single time to see their offered service times. I think this app would fill that niche for Christians looking for a new church as well as increasing exposure to small churches in our communities.

For the features, I would like to have a map with all the location information for the local churches. There would be a point icon similar to that of Moovit or Google Maps to indicate the locations. There would be a filter where you can select churches by service times or open after a certain time. The app would also include a couple pictures about the church (limited to 7 pictures to save viewers' time like Tinder) as well as link to the main website. If a user decides upon one church, the app would redirect to the Google map (or other navigation apps people commonly use) with that location to show the direction. Also, the app can include "events" section to feature special events (e.g. cookout, performance) going on in a church so that people can get more informed. I think this app idea is worthwhile because nobody has filled the niche demand yet.
